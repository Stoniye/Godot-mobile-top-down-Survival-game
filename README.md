I started this project at the beginning of the year but lost motivation after 3-4 months. I estimate that I invested over 100 hours in this game. Although my code is a bit spaghetti-like, I thought I’d upload it. Maybe someone can find it useful! If you’re that someone, feel free to send me a message—I’d love to see what cool things you come up with.

The features I’ve implemented so far include:
- Save/Load of different worlds
- Shop system with openable chests
- Crafting
- Smelting with a furnace
- Building
- Traveling with a rocket to other planets

I’ve designed these systems to be as flexible as possible. In some cases, it only takes a few seconds to add new features or content to the game!

Here are some screenshots of the game:
