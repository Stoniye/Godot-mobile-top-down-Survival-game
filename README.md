I began this project at the beginning of the year but lost motivation after 3-4 months. I estimate that I invested over 100 hours in this game.
Although my code is a bit spaghetti-like, I thought I’d upload it. Maybe someone can use it! If you’re that someone, feel free to send me a
message—I’d love to see what cool things you come up with.

Here are some Screenshots of the Game:
